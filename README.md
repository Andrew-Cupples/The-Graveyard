# The-Graveyard
This is a graveyard of many of my failed projects.

Inhabitants:

**Multi-Lang: **

Desc: An experiment to see if you could change the response of an LLM (Gemini) by having it create responses in different languages and then combine them. The program would generate a story multiple times in the languages you selected then try to merge all the responses together. 
Reasons for Failure: Output was not noticibly different, and similar changes could be made via prompt enginnering without the need for translation, the process took many times longer since the LLM had to generate the response in multiple languages.

**Risk Bot: 
**
Desc: A bot for me to play risk against since the AI's in Risk online are very underwelming. I attempted to use Tesseract to scan board states and have the AI click the screen and play against me.
Reasons for failure: Tesseract had a really hard time identifying the territories since they change color every time, the map could be hardcoded into a graph but getting the AI to see the screen turned out to be very difficult. I might revitalize this later just redo the whole game in an application rather than using Tesseract.

**HexChex:
**
Desc: An attempt to make Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess in a python application
Reasons for failure: I found the game boring and making an AI to play it seemed like a nightmare. I decided to turn this project into BattleCheckers instead.
